/**
 * The admission gates past the first three (PRD v6 §9.3b, TC-9.11, AC-17.4).
 *
 * Staged · Solvable · Not vacuous say the world holds what the scenario
 * presumes, a reference solution passes, and doing nothing fails. They don't
 * say the checks are any good. A check that passes whatever the agent does,
 * a check that only accepts one order of tool calls, and a check that counts
 * a row setup.py wrote are all still "solvable and not vacuous" — and each
 * one turns a run's verdict into noise. So every scenario also passes:
 *
 *   mutation   Mutation controls — at least one wrong action fails the
 *              checks, and every check has a passing and a failing
 *              demonstration. No check that can't fail.
 *   altpaths   Alternate valid paths pass — a second valid solution (the
 *              same end state reached another way) passes too, so the
 *              checks aren't overfit to one path.
 *   setup      Setup can't earn credit — nothing setup.py writes counts
 *              toward a check; credit is only for the agent's own actions.
 *   exploit    Exploit control (PRD v7 §4.10.9, AC-9.24, SHOULD) — a
 *              scripted agent told to cheat (call an off-limits tool, claim
 *              success, address the judge or the simulated caller) scores 0.
 *
 * And one that replaces "Not vacuous" (AC-9.23): a refusal, guardrail or
 * transfer scenario, where declining is correct, passes an empty run by
 * design — so it needs POSITIVE EVIDENCE instead: a required utterance, or
 * a transfer call.
 *
 * Gates carry `since`: the gate-set version that added them. A finished run
 * records the version it was judged by, and is never re-judged by a gate
 * that didn't exist when it ran (coverage.js ADMISSION_GATES_VERSION).
 *
 * A connect-only environment has no world: nothing is staged, so setup can't
 * earn anything, and there is no world to replay a second path against. Those
 * two read "doesn't apply" there. Mutation controls still apply — a wrong
 * call has to fail the judge.
 *
 * Deterministic: most scenarios pass; a few seeded ones fail with the
 * specific reason a compiler would give. A failure quarantines the scenario
 * (coverage.js `admissionOf`). It holds until the scenario is edited — an
 * edit makes the proof stale, re-proving re-runs every gate, and the
 * rewritten scenario passes. That is the same path the first three gates
 * follow.
 *
 * No imports: coverage.js and proofs.js both read this, and envModel.js sits
 * on a cycle with them.
