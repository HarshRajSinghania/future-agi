/**
 * Picking a winner.
 *
 * Six runs, a dozen numbers each, and no two of them agree — the run with the
 * best pass rate is rarely also the fastest or the cheapest. "Which one wins"
 * is therefore not a fact about the runs; it is a question about what this
 * team is optimising for, and the only honest way to answer it is to make them
 * say so first.
 *
 * So a winner is a weighting, applied. The weights are the argument, the
 * ranking is arithmetic, and both are kept with the result — a winner nobody
 * can see the reasoning behind is just a badge.
