/**
 * Adding a new agent version.
 *
 * The environment already outlives any one agent version — scenarios belong to
 * the environment, and a run is env × agent. This is the other half: pulling a
 * newer agent in, seeing exactly what changed, and then making the one choice
 * that decides what the next number means.
 *
 *   RE-DERIVE   the contract changed, so the suite should change with it.
 *               New scenarios cover the new surface. Scores are NOT comparable
 *               to the previous version.
 *
 *   FREEZE      run the identical suite against the new agent. The delta is
 *               attributable to the agent and nothing else. This is a
 *               regression test, and it is the honest default.
 *
 * Picking re-derive when you meant freeze is the classic way to produce a
 * number that looks like an improvement and is not, so the UI states the
 * consequence rather than presenting two equal buttons.
