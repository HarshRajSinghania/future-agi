/*
  Scenarios an improvement created.

  An improvement (a Fix from the Error Feed, a scheduled run) can write
  scenarios of its own: the ones that reproduce what it is fixing. A Fix adds
  the issue's scenarios to the environment as it starts — they were picked on
  the Fix sheet. Others belong to the improvement until a person adds them — from
  the Scenarios tab ("N scenarios from improvements aren't in this
  environment") or from the improvement's own page. Both write the same way,
  through `addImprovementScenariosPatch`, so a scenario added from either
  place reads the same: a proposed exploration row with its source badge.

  Read from the improvement record, whichever field it keeps them on:
    record.issueScenarios   rows the improvement wrote (preferred)
    record.createdScenarios the same, under its older name
  A row already in envState.scenarios is in the environment and isn't listed.
