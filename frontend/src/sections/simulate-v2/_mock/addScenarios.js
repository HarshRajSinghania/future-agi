/**
 * Stamping a new batch of scenarios — the same way whichever route adds it.
 *
 * The Add scenarios drawer, the builder chat on the build screen and the
 * workspace chat all add batches. Each batch records who added it and how,
 * the tools each scenario needs, and the environment version it was added
 * under, so a scenario added on env v2 is not part of env v1 when v1 is
 * pinned again. The scenarios that need a tool this world can't answer are
 * counted, so every route can warn about them.
 *
 * Prove on add. A scenario is stamped proved against this environment
 * version only once it passes the three gates — the starting state it
 * presumes can be staged, a reference solution passes, and its sub-goals
 * fail when the agent does nothing (a declining scenario needs positive
 * evidence instead, so it isn't held to the empty run). One that fails a
 * gate isn't added; the batch says which and why (`rejected`,
 * `rejectedNote`). A row that arrives already proved (rebuilt, or proved
 * where it was written) keeps that proof.
 *
 * Deterministic: the verdict is a fingerprint of the scenario and the
 * environment version, so the same batch on the same world always lands the
 * same way.
