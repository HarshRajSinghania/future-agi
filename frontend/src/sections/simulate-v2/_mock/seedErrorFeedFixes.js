/*
  Seed 19 (RSI PRD exit criteria): Error Feed issues that each reach a
  reviewed proposal with nothing linked by hand.

    ISS-4536 → Airline rebooking agent (repo) — a code change, Ready for
               review, its draft PR one click away
    ISS-4402 → Customer Support Line (Vapi squad) — a prompt change shipped
               as a Vapi copy, released, and seen again: Reopened, so Fix
               again is the next step
    ISS-4366 → Customer Support Line — released over 30 days ago and not
               seen since: Resolved
    ISS-4431 → Customer Support Line — released a few days ago: Watching
    ISS-4529 → Guest booking line (Retell, live numbers pinned) — shipped as
               a Retell draft version
    ISS-4478 → Customer Support Line — No safe improvement, and says why

  The three Customer Support Line releases are numbered and dated in the
  same order (Resolved's first), so its version history reads true.

  Each record is written exactly as Start fix writes one (issueFixRecord),
  with the seeded `compatCheck: 0` and a fixed search seed, so it replays
  identically. Applied to a first-run state and, once, to a stored copy —
  never over an issue someone already ran a fix for, never twice.
